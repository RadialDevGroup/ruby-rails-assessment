As a web user, I want the landing page to tell me I'm visiting a blog, so that I know I'm in the right place

Note: If you haven't already, this is a good time to run `rspec --init` because from here on out you'll be writing tests. Running `rails generate rspec:install` is also important. And you will also need to configure [capybara](https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara#using-capybara-with-rspec).

1. Given a web server
2. When I navigate to the home page
3. Then I see the text "Welcome to my blog"
