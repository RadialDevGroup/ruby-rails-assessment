As a website admin, I want to see a landing page, so I can verify that my server is online.

Note: This is a sanity check for your application, don't worry about writing automated tests just yet

Scenario
1. Given a ruby on rails environment with a blog application
2. When I launch my server
3. And I visit the page (Localhost:3000)
4. Then I see the "Yay! Youâ€™re on Rails!" Page
