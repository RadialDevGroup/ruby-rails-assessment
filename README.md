# Ruby::Rails::Assessment
This is a skills assessment for RSpec posing as a skills assessment for Ruby on Rails. To get started, click on "Use this template" (which will create a repo in your github) and give your proctor access to the repo so they can assess your progress (and review PR's if desired).

- Run each story in order using the test driven development model for development (First two stories excepted)
- After you write the tests make a commit
- After you finish a story make a pull request, requesting that the proctor review it

[The Getting Started with Ruby on Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) is a valuable tool for completing this task.
If this is your first time writing in Ruby you should also read the [Ruby on Rails Developer Journey](https://github.com/RadialDevGroup/Policy/wiki/Developer-Journey%3A-Ruby-on-Rails).

You may use any resource you have at your disposal to accomplish this, so long as you understand what it is you are doing (no blind copy pasta!)
